# GisselleR-Bio-Readme
# ^_^  I'm Gisselle
# :D  I've used Github before. However, I only have a limited knowledge of how to use it.
# ^_-  I have just used it for website hosting, not much programming. (I've used other software for progamming)
# (✿◡‿◡)  I have basic knowledge about technology. I still have a lot to learn, and I want to learn more. I have taken programming classes and done different programs just to learn more. Plus I am still not entirely sure what I want to do in my future career.
# （￣︶￣）↗  Current coding languages: HTML, JAVASCRIPT, CSS, Basic PYTHON & FLASK
# ( ﾉ ﾟｰﾟ)ﾉ  Want to learn: C#
